The game can also be played using other browsers for controllers. For example 8 iPhones, Android phones,
iPads or notebooks. To do this you need to have <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> 0.6.1. Here are the steps

1.  Go to the <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js page</a> and download and install node.js

2.  Download and install git from <a href="http://git-scm.com/">the git site.

3.  Open a terminal, shell or command prompt. cd to the folder of your choice then type

        git clone git://github.com/greggman/octopus.git
        cd octopus
        node server.js

4.  Open http://localhost:8080/octopus.html in your browser.

5.  Figure out the IP address of your machine.

    for osx <a href="http://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=6526">see here</a>.

    for windows <a href="http://grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=1277">see here</a>.

    for linux you probably already know.

6. Make sure each phone is on the same WiFi.

7. On each phone, open a browser and go to http://addressofserver:8080/play.html

   For example my address looks like http://192.168.1.73:8080/play.html

8. In the top left corner of the game it will show how many people have connected.
   Once they are connected click the mouse on the main machine to start the game.

   You probably need at least 4 people to be able to control the octopus.
